Mancala Game Project - Sequence Diagram (MVC, Strategy Pattern)

Participants:
- User (Player)
- MancalaView (View)
- MancalaController (Controller)
- MancalaModel (Model)
- BoardDesign (Strategy Interface)
- BoardHexagon / BoardRegular (Concrete BoardDesigns)

Scenario: User Makes a Move (Click on a Pit)

1. User clicks a pit on the GUI.
2. MancalaView detects the click and notifies MancalaController.
3. MancalaController calls makeMove() on MancalaModel with the selected pit.
4. MancalaModel updates the game state (stones, scores, turn, undo stack).
5. MancalaModel notifies the view to repaint.
6. MancalaView calls draw() on the current BoardDesign (e.g., BoardHexagon).
7. BoardDesign draws the updated board and pits.

Notes:
- UndoManager is involved if the user clicks undo, but is not shown in this main move sequence.
- The BoardDesign is selected at the start (strategy pattern) and can be BoardHexagon or BoardRegular.
- The sequence is the same for both board styles.
